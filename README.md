# virtual-pets-amok

## I created a virtual pet class with subclasses and interfaces to create a virtual pet shelter. The shelter contains both organic and robotic pets.
In additon to feeding, watering, playing with, adopting and dropping off pets. There are ways to track cage cleanliness for organic dogs, oil/maintenance level for robotic animals and to see how dirty the cats litterbox is getting. Dont forget to take the dogs on a walk once in a while.
